/**
 * The resolver plan: what Xray's built-in DNS looks like for a settings object,
 * plus the routing rules that make it safe.
 *
 * Why this exists. The old config listed plain UDP resolvers (1.1.1.1) and let
 * them ride through the proxy. When the server dropped UDP — common — every
 * lookup failed, `IPIfNonMatch` never produced an IP, `geoip:ir` never matched,
 * and "bypass Iran" silently became "everything through the proxy". In TUN mode
 * the whole system's DNS took the same doomed path.
 *
 * The plan, mirroring what v2rayN does:
 *   - remote lookups over DoH (TCP/443), routed to the tunnel exit;
 *   - in bypass modes, an in-country UDP resolver pinned to domestic domains,
 *     with `expectedIPs` so a poisoned answer is discarded, reached DIRECT;
 *   - a `dns` outbound that answers ANY port-53 packet entering the core, so
 *     system DNS in TUN mode never leaves the machine in plain text;
 *   - a resolver can also follow a routing target: a corporate WireGuard's
 *     internal DNS is asked through that WireGuard's own outbound.
 *
 * Everything here is pure; configBuilder splices the result into each plan.
