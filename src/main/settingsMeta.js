 * Which settings are BAKED INTO a running connection.
 *
 * Everything in `RECONNECT_KEYS` is consumed either by buildConfig() (so it ends
 * up inside the xray config.json that was written at connect time) or by a
 * connect-time side effect (system proxy, TUN device, LAN firewall rule).
 * xray-core has no hot reload for any of it, so changing one of these while
 * connected does NOTHING until the tunnel is torn down and rebuilt.
 *
 * Persisting such a change silently is what made the app lie to the user: the
 * settings page showed "bypass Iran", the tunnel was still routing everything
 * global — or worse, the user switched *to* global expecting their traffic to be
 * tunnelled while it kept going direct. The UI now asks, and main.js keeps a
 * snapshot of the settings the live connection was actually built from
 * (see `pendingReconnectKeys`).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT in this list:
 *   killSwitch          — read live from the store when a drop is detected
 *   autoUpdateSubs/Interval — the subscription timer is re-armed in settings:set
 *   lang, theme         — renderer only
