 * LAN is routed into the TUN — that is what makes the router the tunnel for
 * every device without touching any of them. A device the user wants direct
 * needs its packets to escape that rule: the nft chain below marks packets by
 * source MAC, and one `ip rule` with a LOWER preference than sing-box's (8999
 * against its 9000+) sends marked packets to the main table, i.e. out the WAN
 * with fw4's normal NAT. Nothing about sing-box's own tables is edited.
 *
 * Everything in this file is pure or takes its I/O as parameters, so the tests
 * run where the owner works (Windows) and the only thing left to prove on a
 * router is that the kernel accepts the text — which the QEMU job does.
