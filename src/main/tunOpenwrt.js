/**
 * TUN mode on an OpenWrt router: the router is the tunnel for every device
 * behind it.
 *
 * This backend COMPOSES the sing-box one (tunSingbox.js) rather than changing
 * it: sing-box's `auto_route` already routes forwarded LAN traffic into the TUN
 * on Linux (sing-tun's rule set ends in `not iif lo → lookup 2022`), and every
 * port-53 packet with it — so dnsmasq's upstream queries and every client's
 * hard-coded resolver end up at Xray's dns-out without a line of DNS config.
 * What a router adds is around that:
 *
 *   1. an nft table of ours (openwrtNet.buildNftRuleset) that marks packets
 *      from EXCLUDED devices by source MAC, and
 *   2. one `ip rule` (pref 8999, before sing-box's 9000+) that sends marked
 *      packets to the main table — out the WAN, with fw4's normal NAT;
 *   3. a check, after sing-box is up, that the TUN device exists and the
 *      policy route is really there — a gateway that silently is not one
 *      leaks the whole house.
 *
 * Order on start: table → rules → sing-box → verify; any failure rolls back
 * in reverse and the error names the step. The exclusion list is replaced
 * LIVE (atomic nft reload) without touching the tunnel.
 *
 * `managesDns = true`: the service then leaves the leak guard out. The guard
 * rewrites adapter resolvers; on a router the resolver is dnsmasq, which must
 * stay exactly as it is — the port-53 route above is the guard here.
 *
 * Fail-closed on a dead core, fail-open on a dead sing-box: routes into the
 * TUN survive an Xray crash (traffic stops, nothing leaks); a sing-box crash
 * removes its own routes and the LAN goes direct until the service's recovery
 * rebuilds it. This class watches for that exit itself (`active` follows
 * sing-box, `onUnexpectedExit` tells the service); the service watches Xray.
 * A kill switch that closes the window is deliberately not in this version
 * (spec §9).
 *
 * One ordering rule on the way down: rule 8998 goes only once the IRNetFree
 * device is gone. Harmless without sing-box, it is what keeps the router's own
 * LAN replies off a split table 2022 — deleting it under a live one is the
 * v1.13.2 outage again.
