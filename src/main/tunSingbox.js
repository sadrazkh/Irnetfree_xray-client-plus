/**
 * TUN mode (system-wide tunnel) on sing-box.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Xray runs with a local SOCKS inbound (already started by XrayManager).
 *   2. sing-box's `tun` inbound creates the adapter and — with `auto_route` —
 *      lays the v4 AND v6 default routes itself, keeps the proxy server's own
 *      addresses off the tunnel (`route_exclude_address`), binds its own
 *      sockets to the physical NIC (`auto_detect_interface`), and forwards
 *      every packet into that SOCKS. On exit it removes everything it added
 *      (routes, and on Windows the WFP filters `strict_route` installs).
 *   3. We only set the adapter's DNS: the tunnel peer (172.19.0.2), so every
 *      query the OS sends there enters the TUN and reaches Xray's port-53
 *      hijack. No routes are laid by hand.
 *   4. Optional per-app split (`apps`): sing-box's TUN can match traffic by
 *      the packet's OWNING PROCESS on Windows, macOS and Linux — a `direct`
 *      outbound plus a `process_name` route rule sends the chosen apps
 *      around the tunnel (`exclude`) or makes them the only ones inside it
 *      (`only`). Xray cannot do this itself (see procRouter.js's IP
 *      approximation), so this is sing-box-only. A `port: 53` rule is always
 *      inserted ahead of the process rule, unconditionally routed to
 *      socks-out: the adapter's resolver is the tunnel peer, reachable only
 *      through the TUN, so every app must keep resolving through it even
 *      while its other traffic goes the other way — see buildTunConfig.
 *
 * Against tun2socks (tunManager.js) this fixes the two known holes: there is
 * a v6 default route (v6 no longer bypasses the tunnel), and once Xray's
 * direct outbounds are bound to the physical interface (task 2) a `direct`
 * dial no longer re-enters the tunnel through /1 split routes. The proxy core
 * stays Xray: sing-box here is only the TUN → SOCKS forwarder.
 *
 * Requires Administrator (Windows) / root or a one-time password prompt
 * (macOS), sing-box(.exe) in a bin dir, and on Windows wintun.dll next to it.
 *
 * macOS is written blind (no Mac in this round): it mirrors tunManager's
 * startMac step for step — privileged script, pid file, wait for a NEW utun,
 * DNS via networksetup — with sing-box in place of tun2socks and no route or
 * ifconfig lines, because auto_route does those.

 * Pure. The shape below passed `sing-box check` on 1.13.14 with and without
 * strict, with and without exclusions.
 *
 * `ipv6:false` does NOT remove the v6 address: the OS then still gets a v6
 * default route through the TUN, which is exactly what stops the physical
 * adapter's v6 from leaking — Xray simply answers no AAAA in that mode, so
 * nothing v6 is ever dialled. The flag is accepted so callers can pass their
 * settings through unchanged; the config is the same either way.
 *
 * `interfaceName: null` omits `interface_name`: on darwin sing-tun only accepts
 * `utun<N>` and picks the next free unit itself when no name is given.
 *
 * `apps`: `null | { mode: 'exclude' | 'only', names: string[] }`. `null`, an
 * unrecognised `mode`, or no name left after normalisation (trim, drop
 * empties, dedupe keeping the first occurrence and order) leaves the output
 * byte-stable with `apps` absent — no `route.rules`, no `direct` outbound,
 * `route.final` stays `'socks-out'`. With a usable name list a `direct`
 * outbound is added and `route.rules` gets exactly two rules, in this order:
 *   1. `{ port: 53, outbound: 'socks-out' }` — ALWAYS first, and always to
 *      socks-out regardless of mode. The adapter's resolver is the tunnel
 *      peer (172.19.0.2, TUN_PEER4), reachable only *through* the TUN. Without
 *      this rule an excluded app's DNS query would be dialled `direct` to an
 *      address nothing answers, and that app would lose name resolution
 *      entirely. With it, every app resolves through the tunnel resolver and
 *      only the excluded app's *traffic* goes around the tunnel (for `only`,
 *      the reverse: only the named apps' traffic goes through the tunnel,
 *      everyone's DNS still does).
 *   2. `{ process_name: names, outbound: mode === 'exclude' ? 'direct' : 'socks-out' }`.
 * `route.final` becomes `mode === 'exclude' ? 'socks-out' : 'direct'` — the
 * unlisted apps get the opposite of what the listed ones get.
