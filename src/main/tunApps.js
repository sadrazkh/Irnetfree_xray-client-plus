/**
 * Per-app routing under the TUN: whether this connection gets a process rule.
 *
 * sing-box can route a packet by the name of the process that owns it
 * (`process_name`), so the tunnel can carry everything EXCEPT a few apps
 * ('exclude') or nothing except a few apps ('only'). Xray cannot do this at
 * all, and neither can tun2socks — the rule only exists inside the sing-box TUN
 * config, which is why the answer is decided here, at connect time, and baked
 * in (both keys are in RECONNECT_KEYS).
 *
 * Every "no" below is a promise being kept, so each one carries the reason as a
 * log line instead of silently dropping the user's rule:
 *
 *   1. the mode is off (or unrecognised)  — silent: nothing was asked for
 *   2. the mode is on but no app is named — the rule would mean nothing
 *   3. the backend is 'native-macos'      — the macOS service runs a sing-box
 *      TUN, but the app does not write that config: it hands the daemon a fixed
 *      set of fields with no room for a process rule, so the rule would be
 *      accepted here and dropped there. Its own reason, because the fix is a
 *      different one (switch to the compatibility backend).
 *   4. the backend is not sing-box        — tun2socks cannot route by process
 *   5. the leak guard is at 'strict'      — the guard promises that NOTHING
 *      leaves outside the tunnel. `exclude` walks the listed apps around it and
 *      `only` walks the whole rest of the system around it, so BOTH modes break
 *      that promise, not just `exclude`. The guard wins; it is the stronger
 *      claim, and a user who set it is entitled to it.
 *
 * The order matters: the first refusal is the one the user is told about, and
 * it has to be the setting they should go fix first.
 *
 * Node core only (no electron): src/server/service.js runs this headless too.
