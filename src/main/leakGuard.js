/**
 * The leak guard — level `standard`.
 *
 * Phase 2 pointed the TUN adapter's own resolver at the tunnel peer, and that is
 * not enough on either desktop platform:
 *
 *  - Windows sends a query to the resolvers of EVERY connected adapter in
 *    parallel ("smart multi-homed name resolution"). The physical adapters still
 *    carry the ISP's, so the ISP still sees every name the machine looks up, and
 *    the first answer back wins.
 *  - macOS resolves per network service; only the service that owns the default
 *    route was ours.
 *
 * So for the length of a session every physical adapter's DNS is taken — on
 * macOS pointed at the tunnel peer, on Windows held on loopback (WIN_HOLD4, and
 * why not the peer) — and the originals go back afterwards. "Afterwards" includes the
 * ugly cases: a disconnect, a quit, a hard `process.exit`, and — because none of
 * those run when the app is killed or the machine loses power — the next launch,
 * from `userData/tun-state.json`. That file is the whole crash story: it is
 * written BEFORE the first adapter is touched, so a crash in the middle still
 * leaves a complete record of what to put back. Every "my internet broke after
 * the VPN died" report is a guard that had no such file.
 *
 * "Afterwards" pointedly does NOT include a reconnect. A network change, a
 * server switch and a settings apply all tear the tunnel down and build it
 * again, and releasing the guard for the length of that rebuild would put every
 * adapter back on the ISP's resolver — and take the strict firewall with it —
 * for exactly as long as it takes to protect the machine again. So there is
 * `holdForReconnect()`: the override stays, and only the firewall's holes are
 * widened to admit the server the next tunnel is about to dial. During the gap
 * names simply do not resolve. That is the safe answer, and it is the whole
 * design — and on Windows it holds only because the adapters are on loopback:
 * with the TUN adapter gone, the peer routes out of the physical NIC.
 *
 * The other half of the same problem is ownership. Two connects can overlap,
 * and the one that loses still runs its cleanup: without a way to tell whose
 * override is on the machine, the loser's release undoes the winner's guard on
 * a tunnel that is up and carrying traffic. So `engage()` hands back a receipt
 * and `release({ token })` refuses to act on a stale one. A release with no
 * receipt is the user's own intent — disconnect, quit, exit — and always runs.
 *
 * Nothing here runs a command directly: `run`, `runScriptPrivileged` and
 * `runSync` are injected (tunPlatform.js supplies the real ones), so the tests
 * pin the generated script text — the only review these lines get before they
 * run as Administrator on someone's laptop — without spawning anything.
 *
 * Windows note: one `powershell` spawn per operation, never one per adapter.
 * macOS note: `networksetup` needs root, so apply/restore go through
 * `runScriptPrivileged`. Task 1 left no hook to append lines to the TUN setup
 * script, so this is a SECOND password prompt at connect time on macOS (the
 * design accepts one); the crash repair batches its orphan kill and its DNS
 * restore into a single script, so a launch after a crash prompts only once.
