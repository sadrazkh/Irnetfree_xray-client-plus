 * Two more things are deliberately outside the signature:
 *
 *  - Any interface `ignoreInterface(name)` claims. The app creates its OWN

 *    so counting it would make every recovery produce the change that triggers
 *    the next one, forever. The predicate is a parameter rather than baked in
 *    because this function stays pure and directly testable; the watcher passes
 *    the one its owner injected (see NetWatcher#fp).
 *  - IPv6 link-local addresses. Windows hands a recreated adapter a fresh GUID
 *    and therefore a fresh fe80:: address, which says nothing about routing.
 *  - The host-only adapters of other software (see HOST_VIRTUAL_RE). Unlike the
 *    predicate above this one is not the caller's choice: no caller wants a VM
 *    booting to tear its tunnel down, and the app's own injected predicate knows
 *    only about the app's own adapter.
