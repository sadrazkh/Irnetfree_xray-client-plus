 * Paint the remembered theme before anything else does.
 *
 * app.js can only set data-theme once app:init has answered (the preference lives
 * in the backend store), and until then the CSS defaults to dark — so a user on
 * the light theme saw a dark flash on every launch. This runs from <head>, before
 * the body is parsed, and re-applies whatever applyTheme() last resolved to.
 *
 * It is a hint, not the source of truth: app:init still calls applyTheme() and
 * corrects the attribute (which matters for 'system', where the OS may have
 * flipped since). With nothing remembered — a first run — it does nothing at all,
 * leaving the dark default exactly as it was.
 *
 * Loaded as its own file rather than inline because the page's CSP is
 * script-src 'self' (no 'unsafe-inline').
