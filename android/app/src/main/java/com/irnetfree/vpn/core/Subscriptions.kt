/**
 * Fetches a subscription URL and parses it into servers + usage info.
 *
 * WHICH PATH a fetch takes is SubFetch's decision, not this file's (the
 * tunnel, a throwaway core, or the network directly). The TLS itself is
 * Conscrypt's, installed by IRApp so that TLS 1.3 exists on every Android —
 * the owner's panel is behind a Cloudflare zone that accepts nothing older,
 * and the platform TLS on Android 8/9 has nothing newer, which is what every
 * "Handshake failed" here actually was. What is left in this file is the
 * request itself and the three things that make a direct one as survivable
 * as it can be:
 *
 *  - THE RESOLVER (TrustedResolver below). DoH first, the OS second.
 *  - THE RETRY. An SSL failure is tried again with the ClientHello split across
 *    TCP segments (FragmentedSocketFactory), which is the one thing a client
 *    can do about a middlebox matching on the SNI without a tunnel to hide in.
 *  - THE REPORT. A failure names the address reached and the certificate that
 *    came back, because "handshake failed" cannot tell a censored panel from a
 *    broken one. Through a SOCKS route none of it applies: OkHttp leaves the
 *    name unresolved on purpose, so the core resolves and dials it at the far end.
 *
 * TLS stays permissive (MODERN + COMPATIBLE + CLEARTEXT) because many panels
 * are old. A v2rayNG-style User-Agent makes them return the base64 config list
 * AND the Subscription-Userinfo usage header.

     * server can be in (198.18/15 and friends). That catches a fake-IP gateway.
     * It does not catch what a subscription host actually gets, which is a
     * PUBLIC address belonging to the censor: perfectly routable, not suspect by
     * any test of the number itself, and the TLS handshake then fails because
     * the machine it reaches was never the panel. A subscription URL is exactly
