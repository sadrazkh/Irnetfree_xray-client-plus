 * Only the arithmetic lives here — no sockets, no Android — so the rule that
 * decides which server wins can be tested off a device, which is the only way it
 * gets tested at all (see docs: CI is the compile gate, there is no phone in it).
 *
 * The measuring itself is the caller's job, because a phone cannot afford the
 * desktop's version of it: Windows measures a real round trip through every
 * server at once, while here each one costs a throwaway core. So the UI measures
 * the handshake to all of them in parallel and a real round trip through only
 * the few that answered fastest, and hands both numbers to [pick].
