/**
 * The design tokens, from the Android design doc (mint on a near-black green).
 *
 * Every screen reads these names rather than a literal, so the palette is one
 * place — the old blue-on-navy values were spread across MainActivity as private
 * vals and could not be changed without touching every screen.
 *
 * Typography: the design specifies Space Grotesk for UI and JetBrains Mono for
 * metrics. Neither is bundled — a font asset that fails to download breaks the
 * build, and the APK already carries three cores — so metrics use the platform
 * monospace (Roboto Mono), which is what carries the design's character, and UI
 * text uses the platform sans (the Material default, so nothing has to name it).
 * Swapping in the real families later is a res/font drop plus this one val.
