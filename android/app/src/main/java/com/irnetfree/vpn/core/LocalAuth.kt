/**
 * The per-session credentials of the tunnel's own local inbounds.
 *
 * socks-in and http-in listen on fixed ports of 127.0.0.1 — and loopback is
 * shared by every app on the phone. Open, they let any installed app (the state
 * apps users must keep included) ask them for the VPN's exit address and so
 * detect the VPN: the 2025 "localhost SOCKS" class. Each connect therefore puts
 * a fresh random username/password on both (ConfigBuilder, SingboxConfig); hev
 * presents it (XrayVpnService.writeTun2socksConfig) and so does every client of
 * the app's own that goes through the tunnel (LocalProxyAuth below). Hex only:
 * the values go into hev's YAML in single quotes (TunnelSetup doubles a quote
 * all the same) and into JSON untouched.
