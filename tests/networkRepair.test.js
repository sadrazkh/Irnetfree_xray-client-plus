 * "Recover network" (the diagnostics dialog's fourth button) must never take a
 * live VPN down.
 *
 * It was reviewed as a read-only action, sitting beside three read-only buttons,
 * and its own failure text said "Disconnect first, then retry" — while the
 * handler called doDisconnect() unconditionally, on every platform. On Windows
 * and Linux, where the darwin block is skipped entirely, that made the whole
 * action "drop the connection and release an already-released guard".
 *
 * repairNetwork() lives inside main.js / service.js, which cannot be required
 * here (electron; and requiring service.js would build a live headless service).
 * So this reads the two sources: the same test that proves the refusal also
 * proves the two mirrors still say it identically, which is the thing that
 * silently rots.
